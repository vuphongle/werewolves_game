A self-hosted multiplayer social deduction game (only one person needs to run
the app). Built with Python (Flask) and WebSockets, supporting 24 unique roles,
**no Narator needed**, mobile "Pass-and-Play" support, multiple simultaneous
languages, and automated vote and death logic.
[Install Instructions](#setup-and-running-the-project) or Download server app
for
[Android(apk) and Linux(x86)](https://github.com/davidchilin/werewolves_game/releases).

## **Description**

This application is a web-based implementation of the classic party game
_Werewolves_. Players (minimum of 4, ideally +7) join a lobby using a unique
game code (default "w"), are secretly assigned roles (Villager, Wolf, Seer,
...), and then cycle through "night" and "day" phases. During the night, wolves
secretly choose a player to eliminate, and the seer can investigate a player's
role. During the day, players discuss and vote to lynch whoever they suspect is
a wolf. The game supports complex interactions: linked lovers by Cupid,
chain-reaction deaths (Honeypot/Hunter), solo-winning roles (Serial
Killer/Fool), and "Ghost Mode" where dead players can still influence the game
outcome.

The game is designed to be played alongside a separate video or voice chat (like
_Jitsi Meet_ or Zoom), where the real-time discussion and deception take place
**OR** in person using one to several devices in **Pass-and-Play** mode.

## **Core Features**

<img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/lobby.jpg" width="25%" align="right"/>

- **📱 Pass-and-Play Mode:** Play with a single phone (or several) passed around
  the room. The UI guides players to confirm their identity before revealing
  their private role screen.
- **👻 Ghost Mode:** Dead players aren't just spectators. If enabled, ghosts
  have a small chance to participate during accusation and lynch vote phase.
- **🎭 24 Unique Roles:** Including complex roles like the **Alpha Werewolf**,
  **Prostitute**, **Lawyer**, and **Serial Killer**.
- シ **Multiple Language** - Play a single game in multiple languages
  simultaneously.
- **🏆 Solo Win Conditions:** Neutral roles like the **Monster**, **Fool**, or
  **Demented Villager** can win alone, ignoring team allegiances.

- **Robust Admin Controls:** The admin is first player to join the lobby OR
  player using the DEFAULT_ADMIN_CODE. Admin has the ability to:
  - Exclude players from the lobby
  - Start the game once enough players have joined (minimum of 4)
  - Set custom timer durations (in seconds) for the Night, Accusation, and Lynch
    Vote phases
  - Set a new game code
  - Set admin only chat
  - Turn on **Pass-and-Play**, **Ghost Mode**, **Solo-wins**
  - Transfer **admin** status
- **Persistent Sessions:** Players can refresh their browser or momentarily
  disconnect without losing their place in the game (although timer might be
  incorrect)
- **Live Game Updates and Chat:** The UI updates in real-time for all players
  using WebSockets, showing phase changes, player status, game chat, and game
  log events.
- **Dynamic Role Assignment:** At the start of the game, players are randomly
  and secretly assigned roles.
  - "Random Roles" button calculates a balanced setup based on role weights
    (positive for villagers, negative for wolves).
- **Automated Game Loop & Win Conditions:** The game automatically cycles
  through phases. After each death (from a wolf kill, a lynch vote) the system
  checks for win conditions:
  - **Villagers Win:** When all wolves have been eliminated.
  - **Wolves Win:** When the number of living wolves is equal to or greater than
    the number of living non-wolves.
  - **🏆 Solo Win Conditions:** Neutral roles like the **Monster**, **Fool**, or
    **Demented Villager** can win alone, ignoring team allegiances.
  - When a win condition is met, a "Game Over" screen is displayed to all
    players, showing the winning team, the reason for victory, and a list of all
    players and their final roles.

## **Game Phases**

<img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/game_over.png" width="50%" align="right"/>

- **Night Phase:**

  - Phase ends when either the timer runs out OR all Wolves and the Seer have
    submitted their actions.
  - After completing night's actions, the game checks if a winning condition has
    been met before proceeding to accusation phase.

- **Accusation Phase:**

  - Phase ends when either the timer runs out OR all living players have made an
    accusation.
  - Living players vote to accuse one person.
  - Ghost have a 25% chance to accuse.
  - A live tally of accusations is displayed next to each player's name.
  - Tie-Breaking Logic: If there is a tie for the most accused player:
    - If the tie is between only two players, no lynch vote occurs.
    - If the tie is among more than two players, the accusation phase is
      restarted once. A second tie results in no lynch vote.

- **Lynch Vote Phase:**

  - If a single player has the most accusations, a trial begins.
  - Phase ends when either the timer runs out OR all living players have voted.
  - Living players vote "Yes" or "No" to lynch the accused player. A majority
    "Yes" vote is required. Ghost have a 10% chance to vote during Lynch Vote.
  - If the timer expires, any non-voting player defaults to a "No" vote.
  - A detailed summary of who voted "Yes" and "No" is displayed in the game log.
  - After the vote, the game checks if a winning condition has been met before
    proceeding to the night.

- **General Day Phase Actions:** Living players can discuss who the wolf is, and
  can vote to end the day phase early (minimum 30 seconds) and start the
  accusation process. The Werewolves must coordinate openly during the day
  phase, don't look too suspicious. If a majority choose sleep, the game
  transitions to night.

## **Roles**

The game now supports **24 unique roles**:

### 🌻 The Village

## **Setup and Running**

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/davidchilin/werewolves_game.git
    cd werewolves_game
    ```

    or download werewolves_game-master.zip and unzip to folder werewolves_game.

2.  **Edit** `.env.werewolves` file. Change _FLASK_SECRET_KEY_ to
    _something_long_random, CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS_ to desired game web address
    like:
    http://127.0.0.1:5000,http://your.ip.here:5000,https://your.site.here:5000
    OR leave blank to disable CORS and use any site.

3.  **EITHER** run via Dockerfile (steps 3A & 5) **OR** through docker-compose
    (steps 3B & 5) **OR** install and run locally (steps 3C-5).

    A. Build docker and run. You can change port used in browser to 8080 for
    example: -p 8080:5000.

    ```bash
    docker build -t werewolves_game -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile .
    docker run -p 5000:5000 --name werewolves_game werewolves_game
    ```

    B. Build docker compose and run.

    ```bash
    docker compose -f dockerfiles/docker-compose.yml up --build
    docker compose -f dockerfiles/docker-compose.yml up
    ```

    For nginx docker compose version: edit `.env.werewolves` file: NGINX_PORT to
    desired port (default 5000) and server_name in nginx.conf

    ```bash
    docker compose -f dockerfiles/docker-compose-nginx.yml up --build
    docker compose -f dockerfiles/docker-compose-nginx.yml up
    ```

    C. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    - Windows:

      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - macOS / Linux:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-SocketIO python-dotenv
    ```

5.  **Run the App:**

    ```bash
    FLASK_APP=app.py flask run -h 0.0.0.0
    ```

    OR alternatively for better performance and security run the Flask app
    through your preferred GAME_PORT and gunicorn:

    ```bash
    pip install gunicorn gevent
    export GAME_PORT=5001
    gunicorn --worker-class gevent -w 1 -b 0.0.0.0:$GAME_PORT app:app
    ```

    AND if you use LetsEncrypt for SSL, you can deploy gunicorn with SSL, and
    copy your certificates with `deploy_certs.sh`, also update `.env.werewolves`
    USE_HTTPS=true:

    ```bash
    sudo ./deploy_certs.sh cpu_user_name my.site.com
    export GAME_PORT=5001
    gunicorn --worker-class gevent -w 1 -b 0.0.0.0:$GAME_PORT   --certfile=./ssl_certs/fullchain.pem   --keyfile=./ssl_certs/privkey.pem   app:app
    ```

6.  **Access the game:** Open your web browser and go to game web address and
    port set in `.env.werewolves CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Defaults:
    `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Open multiple tabs or browsers to simulate
    different players joining the game. Initial Game Code is `W` and first
    player to join is **Admin**, or Initial Admin Code is `BLM`.

### Game Configuration (config.py)

- DEFAULT_CODE: Set initial default game_code, normally `W`, case insensitive.
- DEFAULT_ADMIN_CODE: Default game_admin_code, normally `BLM`, case insensitive.
- DEFAULT_LANGUAGE: Set to "es" or "de" to change the server default.
- TIME_NIGHT / TIME_ACCUSATION: Change default durations (seconds).
- PAUSE_DURATION: Seconds to pause between phases (to read text).
- DEFAULT_ROLES: Which roles are auto-selected on a fresh boot.

### Add Your Own Roles

1. roles.py: Create a class inheriting from Role. Define team, night_action,
   etc.
2. app.py: Import your new role and add it to AVAILABLE_ROLES dict.
3. static/game.js: Add the role key (const) and update updateRoleTooltip
   colors/icons.
4. static/en.json (and others): Add name/description to "roles" object.

### Add Localization / Language Translation

<img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/android.jpg" width="30%" align="right"/>

In order to add your language you must add/edit language files, for example
static/de.json for Deutsch AND edit templates/index.html (add `option value` and
`loginTranslations`) AND add "de" to app.py `for lang in ["en", "es", "de"]:`.
Bonus: add fastlane documentation for F-Droid.

### Android App

Check it out in
[Releases](https://github.com/davidchilin/werewolves_game/releases), autobuild
using github actions! Just make sure all players are on the same WIFI. All files
to build in Android Studio are in folder **android**. Move werewolves_game
python, static, templates, img into `android/app/src/main/python/`
